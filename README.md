# Hand-cricket
The idea of this project came into my mind when I played the GUI pen fight android game .
If such classroom games can be developed then why not hand cricket.
First and foremost I learnt Python which helped me in decorating the output using Colorama.
After learning the entire course, I started developing the game. 
Now here I am with fully prepared code for the game named Hand Cricket.
Recollecting the jolly days when we used to play hand cricket during our school leisure period.
That's all.
